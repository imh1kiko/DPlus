# DPlus
Just a simple counter built with Godot.\
... like seriously. I just needed a counter, ok? 

I ain't gonna put 100 hours into learning a different language just to make a buggier and smaller in size. UI coding sucks and you know it.

# Key-map
```
A | ←     Minus
D | →     Plus
R         Reset
Q | Esc   Quit
```

# Why this?
Pros:

• You need to count your friend's/own deaths (I'm not sure if it counts if not focused, as mine was prior. I might consider adding something to stop keybinds from functioning, but currently, don't care to).

• Low CPU/GPU (0% on idle, thanks to Godot's "Low CPU mode", meaning no app rerenders, if nothing changes). You can freely leave this in the background, and it won't do jackshit. I hate poor optimization, and while I'm not an expert, I'll try to minimize it.

Cons:

• Size. 30 megs is beyond much. I'd honestly wish I could cram it down to like 400kb. The only things that should take the size are scripts and font. And the sad part is, even stripping godot to bare-minimum, it won't get down nowhere to size.
